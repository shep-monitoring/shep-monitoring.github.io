<h1>2. Install/Upgrade Continuous Water Quality Data Monitoring Stations</h1>

<p>As part of the Savannah Harbor Expansion Project, the US Army Corps of Engineers, Savannah District committed to install and/or upgrade eight continuous water quality data monitoring stations in the Savannah Harbor estuary.  Once installed, the SHEP will operate the gages for one year pre-construction, during construction, and for ten years post-construction.  In addition, four of the gages will be maintained for the 50-year life of the project.</p>

<p>The goal of this task is install eight fully functional continuous water quality data recorders, with the capability to record all applicable monitoring parameters necessary to define the complex interactions within the estuarine ecosystem, and the quantity and quality of water available. All eight stations will have the same parameters.  Each location is currently in a different existing state.  Two locations have no existing gage, some have only a few parameters, and others have almost all of the required parameters.  For cost
estimate purposes, the eight locations have been split into “new” gages and “upgrade existing” gages.  For three of the “new” gages, there is actually already a gage in place with a USGS ID#.  However, the existing parameters are minimal such that enough new equipment is required to be termed a “new” gage.</p>
