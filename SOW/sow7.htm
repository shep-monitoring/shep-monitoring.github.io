<h1>7. Sampling Of Cadmium-Laden Sediments in the Savannah Harbor Dredged Material Containment Areas</h1>
 
<p>As part of the Savannah Harbor Expansion Project, the US Army Corps of Engineers, Savannah District (Corps) committed to sampling cadmium-laden dredged material after it is removed from the Savannah River and placed in Dredged Material Containment Areas (DMCAs) 14A and/or 14B as a part of efforts to minimize wildlife exposure to bioavailable cadmium. DMCAs that receive materials from reaches of the river known to contain cadmium-laden soils will be maintained in a ponded condition throughout the construction period. Therefore, the sediment sampling described in this scope of work will be conducted in a wet environment covered with 1 to 2 feet of water. In coordination with Planning Division (PD), the Savannah District Geotechnical and HTRW Branch (EN-G) will conduct the field work and oversee the task orders necessary to complete the laboratory analyses described in this scope of work.</p>
 
<p><span class="sectionName">PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE</span>:  The field work described above will occur in at least three separate events:</p>

<ul>
  <li><p>Sub-Task A: during placement of inner harbor sediments from Stations 6+375 to 45+000, 51+000 to 57+000, and 80+125 to 90+000; scheduled to begin in September of 2014 and is estimated to last 25 weeks.</p></li>
  <li><p>Sub-Task B: upon completion of placement of inner harbor sediments from Stations 6+375 to 45+000, 51+000 to 57+000, and 80+125 to 90+000.</p></li>
  <li><p>Sub-Task C: upon completion of the placement of the covering sediments.</p></li>
</ul>
