<h1>24. Bird Tissue Analysis in Dredged Material Containment Areas 14A and/or 14B</h1>
 
<p>As part of the Savannah Harbor Expansion Project, the US Army Corps of Engineers, Savannah District (Corps) committed to perform avian blood/feather monitoring of birds in the Dredged Material Containment Areas (DMCAs) designated to receive sediments containing high concentrations of cadmium.  The current project design calls for the majority of these sediments to be placed in DMCA 14A.  When/if this DMCA reaches capacity, the remainder of any sediments from reaches known to contain cadmium-laden sediments will be placed in DMCA 14B.  This Scope of Work (SOW) outlines the work necessary to conduct bird tissue monitoring in within those DMCAs during year 1 of the construction period and during years 1, 2, and 3 of the post-construction monitoring period.  The contractor will conduct all necessary DMCA 14A/14B bird tissue monitoring and report on each year’s findings.</p>
 
<p>The contractor shall provide all professional staff, support staff, and specialists necessary to plan, supervise, perform, and report the required work.  Work required will consist of:  (A) Preparation of a Work Plan; (B) Fieldwork; (C) Lab Analysis; and (D) Report Preparation (Management Summary, Draft and Final Reports).  The specific objective of this work effort is to determine if the birds using these DMCAs are absorbing cadmium as a result of their use of the site(s).</p>
 
<p><span class="sectionName">PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE</span>: All work under this task order shall be completed within the years specified in relation to the construction date.</p>
