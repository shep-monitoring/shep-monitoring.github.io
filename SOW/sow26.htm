<h1>26. Shortnose Sturgeon and Striped Bass Habitat Monitoring</h1>
 
<p>Evaluations of the impacts of the SHEP on Shortnose sturgeon and Striped bass habitats would be conducted in years 2, 4, and 9 of the Post-Construction Monitoring.  The field data collected in other tasks would be used in conjunction with the updated hydrodynamic and water quality models to conduct this assessment.  A report would be prepared at the end of each year the evaluations are performed.  The report would assess any further impacts to Shortnose sturgeon and Striped bass habitats beyond that described in the EIS. </p>
