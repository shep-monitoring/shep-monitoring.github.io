<h1>3. Update Hydrodynamic and Water Quality Models</h1>

<p>As part of the Savannah Harbor Expansion Project (SHEP), the US Army Corps of
Engineers, Savannah District has committed to update the hydrodynamic and water
quality models developed for the project if it is decided that an update is
warranted. Any model revisions would be reviewed by the natural resource
agencies.</p>

<p>Much of
this work is linked to construction activities. For these scopes focused on
modeling and monitoring the term “construction” applies to construction work
taking place in the inner harbor or upper estuary. It does not include any
outer harbor construction as those activities are not expected to significantly
impact water quality or salinity within the upper estuary.</p>

<p>The
goal of these tasks is to develop a tool for describing water quality impacts
(salinity and dissolved oxygen) due to SHEP in the Savannah River estuary based
on best available information. These tools will enable decision makers in
determining project impacts and if necessary any adaptive management
strategies. </p>

<p><span class="sectionName">PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE</span>: Tasks
may be initiated as early as February 2013 but are not to be completed prior to
the pre-construction data collection effort and intensive environmental
sampling events.</p>
