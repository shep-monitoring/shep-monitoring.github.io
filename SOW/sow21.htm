<h1>21. Impact Assessment Review</h1>
 
<p>Data collected from the bathymetric surveys, the intense hydrologic surveys, and the continuous water quality monitors, the fish monitoring, and the wetland monitoring would be used to assess the level of environmental impacts and evaluate the effectiveness of the mitigation features.</p>

<p>The collected data will be used to periodically check the calibration of the hydrodynamic and water models, to improve their accuracy.  The District will update the calibration of the EFDC model using data collected during the Pre-Construction Monitoring period.  That updated version would then be used in two ways: (1) establish ranges of water quality expected to occur at specific sites over a range of river flows, and (2) identify the way in which the estuary would respond with specific river flows.  That Pre-Construction version of the hydrodynamic and water models would be revised as construction takes place to incorporate the physical changes that are being made to the harbor and would be recalibrated again when the dredging is complete to produce a Post-Construction version.</p>
