<h1>16. Monitoring of 12 Wetland Sites in the Savannah Harbor</h1>
 

<p>As part of the Savannah Harbor Expansion Project, the US Army Corps of Engineers, Savannah District (Corps) committed to monitor 12 marsh sites to help assess the impacts associated with changes in salinity due to construction of the project.  The specific objective of this work effort is to identify environmental changes during the monitoring period.  This Scope of Work (SOW) outlines the work necessary to monitor 12 marsh sites in the Savannah River estuary in Georgia and South Carolina.  The field work would generally replicate the procedures used by the USGS Florida Fish and Wildlife Cooperative Research Unit when they monitored these wetlands in the past.  Tidal influence is prevalent at the sites and boat access will be required.</p>
 
<p>The Contractor shall provide all professional staff, support staff, and specialists necessary to plan, supervise, perform, and report the required work.  Work required will consist of fieldwork, lab analysis, and report preparation (Management Summary, Draft and Final Reports).</p>
 

<p><span class="sectionName">PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE</span>: All work under this task order shall be completed within the years specified in relation to the construction date.</p>
 
<p>For during-construction monitoring, the Coop Unit would monitor the 12 sites established during the pre-construction monitoring period in years 2, 3 and 4 when dredging occurs in the inner harbor.  A report of the data collected and any findings would be provided after each year of monitoring.</p>
 
<p>For post-construction monitoring (after dredging is complete), the Coop Unit would monitor the 12 sites in the same manner for 10 years.  A report of the data collected would be provided after each year of monitoring.  A comprehensive report of the data collected and any findings would also be prepared at the conclusion of year 10.</p>
