<h1>12. Hydrodynamic and Water Quality Model Assessment</h1>
 
<p>Commitments made as outlined in the January 2012 SHEP GRR and Tier II EIS state that consideration for revising the SHEP hydrodynamic and water quality models will be made at specified intervals throughout the project’s construction and adaptive management phases. Specifically, these assessments will be made once during project construction and twice during post-construction.</p>
 
<p>The goal of this work is to have the best available tool for describing water quality impacts due to SHEP in the Savannah River harbor and estuary. These tools will enable decision makers by having the best available information in determining project impacts and if necessary any adaptive management strategies. Specifically this will require the A-E contractor to 1) assess the performance of the hydrodynamic (EFDC) and water quality (WASP) models for SHEP and if necessary 2) further refine and update the models. This effort will take advantage of previous modeling efforts and the most current information collected in the Savannah River harbor and estuary.  These models will continue to be used for determining SHEP mitigation feature performance and, if warranted, developing adaptive management strategies. Specifically, the models ability to predict currents, salinity and dissolved oxygen in the estuary will be the focus of these tasks.</p>
 
<p><span class="sectionName">PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE</span>: There will be three separate performance periods for this task: one during construction and two during post-construction monitoring (year 2 and again in year 6). These tasks will also require results of the intensive sampling events and collection of bathymetry data.</p>
