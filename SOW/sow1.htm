<h1>1. Establishment of a Historic Baseline Databank and Establishment of a Geographic Information System</h1>

<p> The US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Savannah District has recently completed studies for the Savannah Harbor Expansion Project (SHEP), which include deepening the Savannah Harbor
deep-draft navigation channel from an authorized depth of -42 feet Mean Lower Low Water (MLLW) to -47 feet MLLW.  The expansion project will consist of deepening the existing navigation channel including Kings Island Turning Basin, eight berths at Garden City Terminal, two proposed meeting areas and three proposed bend wideners.   Construction of the project also includes a mitigation plan to compensate for unavoidable impacts to the environment.  To ensure the project and its mitigation features are performing as intended, USACE has developed an extensive Monitoring and Adaptive Management Plan (MAMP). </p>

<p> The services to be performed will consist of literature search, research of existing data resources including but not limited to USACE published and unpublished data, and establishment and maintenance  of a baseline data bank for each of the major resource types/components in the MAMP.  The baseline data bank will be combined with SHEP monitoring data and integrated into an online Geographic Information System (GIS) and web portal that is accessible to USACE, the Cooperating Agencies (US Environmental Protection Agency, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, US Fish and Wildlife Service, Georgia Ports Authority, and the Georgia Department of Transportation).  Portions of the GIS and web portal will be made available for public access as outlined in the MAMP. </p>

<p><span class="sectionName">PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE</span>: The period of performance shall be from date of award through February 28, 2015. It is the intent of the US Army Corps of Engineers, Savannah District to have the UGA Center for Geospatial Research duplicate the work in Tasks 3, 4, 5, and 6 through the harbor deepening (3-4 years) and 10 years after the new work dredging is completed.</p>
