<h1>8. Monitoring of Effluent from the Savannah Harbor Dredged Material Containment Areas</h1>
  
<p>As part of the Savannah Harbor Expansion Project (SHEP), the US Army Corps of Engineers, Savannah District (Corps) committed to monitor water quality in the effluent from the Dredged Material Containment Areas (DMCAs) to ensure no applicable water quality standards are violated (refer to the Savannah Harbor Monitoring Plan and the Georgia Department of Natural Resources Water Quality Certification, dated February 16, 2011).  This scope of work applies to all the DMCAs used for SHEP new work sediments.  The Savannah District Hydrology and Hydraulics Branch (EN-H) will conduct the field work in coordination with Planning Division (PD).</p>
  
<p>Additional effluent monitoring will be performed to identify effluent from the DMCAs that receive sediments with elevated levels of cadmium.  The current project design calls for the majority of those sediments to be placed in DMCA 14A.  When/if this DMCA reaches capacity, the remainder of any sediments from reaches known to contain cadmium-laden sediments will be placed in DMCA 14B.  That additional monitoring is described in a separate scope of work.</p>
  
<p><span class="sectionName">PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE</span>:  The work described above will begin upon commencement of inner harbor dredging for the Savannah Harbor Expansion Project, currently scheduled to begin in September 2014, and continue throughout the duration of the construction period, estimated to be 4 years.</p>
