<h1>23. Monitoring of Cadmium in Effluents from the Savannah Harbor Dredged Material Containment Areas</h1>
 
<p>As part of the Savannah Harbor Expansion Project, the US Army Corps of Engineers, Savannah District (Corps) committed to monitor the effluent from the Dredged Material Containment Areas (DMCAs) designated to receive cadmium-laden soils (refer to the Georgia Department of Natural Resources Water Quality Certification dated February 16, 2011).  The current project design calls for the majority of these sediments to be placed in DMCA 14A.  When/if this DMCA reaches capacity, the remainder of any sediments from reaches known to contain cadmium-laden sediments will be placed in DMCA 14B.  The Savannah District Hydrology and Hydraulics Branch (EN-H) will conduct the field work in coordination with Planning Division (PD).  Geotechnical and HTRW Branch (EN-G) will manage the task order associated with laboratory analyses.</p>
 
<p>Additional monitoring will be performed of all DMCA effluents used for the SHEP new work sediments.  Additional monitoring will also be performed of the cadmium concentration of cadmium-laden new work sediments that are deposited in the DMCAs.  Those monitoring efforts are described in separate scopes of work.</p>
 
<p><span class="sectionName">PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE</span>: The work described above will begin upon commencement of inner harbor dredging for the Savannah Harbor Expansion Project in reaches of the river known to contain cadmium-laden sediments (Stations 6+375 to 45+000, 51+000 to 57+000, and 80+125 to 90+000), currently scheduled to begin in September 2014.  Dredging in these four reaches is expected to last 25 weeks, and sampling will continue for one year after completion of placement of sediment from these reaches in the DMCAs.</p>
