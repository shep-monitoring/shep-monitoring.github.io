<h1>25. Sampling of Maintenance Sediments Overlying Exposed Miocene Soils in the Savannah Harbor Federal Navigation Channel</h1>
 
<p>As part of the Savannah Harbor Expansion Project, the US Army Corps of Engineers, Savannah District (Corps) committed to sampling newly-accumulated maintenance material in reaches known to have contained cadmium-laden new work sediments in the Savannah Harbor Federal Navigation Channel.  In coordination with Planning Division (PD), Savannah District’s Geotechnical and HTRW Branch (EN-G) and Navigation Branch (OP-N) will conduct the field work and oversee the task orders necessary to complete the laboratory analyses described in this scope of work.  The field work described below will be performed twice -- prior to the first and second maintenance dredging cycles after the channel is deepened in the relevant reaches (Stations 6+375 to 45+000, 51+000 to 57+000, and 80+125 to 90+000).</p>
 
<p><span class="sectionName">PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE</span>: The field work described above in Sub-Tasks A and B will occur in at least two separate events:   prior to the first and second maintenance dredging cycles after the channel is deepened in the relevant reaches (Stations 6+375 to 45+000, 51+000 to 57+000, and 80+125 to 90+000).</p>
