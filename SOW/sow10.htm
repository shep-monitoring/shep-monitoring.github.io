<h1>10. Intensive Water Quality/Hydrologic Sampling Event(s)</h1>
 
<p>Extensive hydrodynamic and hydrologic modeling has been done to estimate as well as possible major impacts to the harbor as a result of the harbor deepening.  In 2006, Tetra Tech enhanced EFDC and WASP models to allow evaluation of various deepening scenarios and a variety of other changes in the estuary system.  The model was calibrated to the most comprehensive available data at the time, which was from 1997 & 1999.  Given the dynamic nature of the river, capability to collect better data and advancement in engineering methods, the model(s) may need to be updated to reflect current pre-project condition as accurately as possible.   In addition, the model(s) precision would be revisited twice during the post construction period, and updated if necessary.  In order for these to be accomplished, a robust data set must be developed for model calibration.</p>
 
<p>The goal of the intensive sampling events is to develop a dataset that is robust enough to use for the continued calibration and evolution of the hydrodynamic and hydrologic models for the Savannah estuary system.  Salinity is one of the key parameters in the model, because it dictates how well the model is transporting mass in the system.  Salinity is also a difficult parameter to capture with a single gage, since there is significant stratification within the water column, as well as a large tidal impact.  While gage data can be used, they are usually at a fixed location and do not represent the whole water column.</p>

<p><span class="sectionName">PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE</span>:  One intensive sampling event will take place during pre-construction.  Two intensive sampling events will take place during the first and fifth years of the post construction period.</p>
