<h1>6. Monitoring of Dissolved Oxygen Levels in the Vicinity of the Hydraulic Cutterhead Dredge During Summer Months</h1>
 
<p>As part of the Savannah Harbor Expansion Project, the US Army Corps of Engineers, Savannah District (Corps) committed to monitor dissolved oxygen (D.O.) levels in the vicinity of hydraulic pipeline dredges performing dredging for both maintenance and new work purposes in the inner harbor during the summer months (July 1st to September 30th).  The Savannah District Hydrology and Hydraulics Branch (EN-H) will conduct the field work in coordination with Planning Division (PD). </p>
 
<p>The Georgia Department of Natural Resources, Environmental Protection Division (GA DNR-EPD) issued a Water Quality Certification for SHEP on February 16, 2011. That certification requires monitoring of dissolved oxygen in the vicinity of maintenance dredging operations in Savannah Harbor. Since the new work dredging typically includes removal of an overburden of maintenance sediments, Savannah District will monitor dissolved oxygen levels in the vicinity of all SHEP dredging operations (new work and maintenance) in the inner harbor. The 2011 GA DNR certification also requires preparation of monitoring plan for EPD’s review and approval.</p>
 
<p><span class="sectionName">PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE</span>:  The work described above will begin upon commencement of inner harbor dredging for the Savannah Harbor Expansion Project, currently scheduled to begin in September 2014, and continue throughout the duration of the construction period, estimated to be 4 years.</p>
