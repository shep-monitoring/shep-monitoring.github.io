<h1>9. Data Collection from Continuous Water Quality Monitoring Stations in Savannah Estuary System</h1>
 

<p>As part of the Savannah Harbor Expansion Project, the US Army Corps of Engineers, Savannah District committed to install and/or upgrade eight continuous water quality data monitoring stations in the Savannah Harbor estuary.  Once installed, the SHEP will operate the gages for one year pre-construction, during construction, and for ten years post-construction.  In addition, four of the gages will be maintained for the 50-year life of the project. </p>
 
<p>The goal of preconstruction monitoring is to establish a baseline set of data to assist with impact assessments during the construction and post construction phases.  The goal of monitoring during construction period and post-construction is to ensure that the project features, including flow re-routing in the estuary, are functioning as they were designed.</p>
 
<p><span class="sectionName">PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE</span>: Monitoring will take place on all eight stations pre-construction, during construction, and for 10 years after construction.  Monitoring will continue after the tenth year on four of the eight stations.</p>
