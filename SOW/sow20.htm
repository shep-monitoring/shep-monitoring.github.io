<h1>20. Fish Distribution Along Marshes in the Savannah Harbor</h1>

<p>As part of the Savannah Harbor Expansion Project, the US Army Corps of Engineers, Savannah District committed to monitor the distribution of fish, crab, and shrimp along the edges of the marsh in the pre-construction period and during years 1, 3, 5, and 9 of the post-construction monitoring period.  The construction is presently expected to last 4-5 years, so there will likely be a 4-5 year gap between the first sampling and the start of the subsequent events.  This Scope of Work (SOW) outlines the work necessary to monitor fish, crab and shrimp abundance and distribution in the Savannah River Estuary, Georgia and South Carolina. </p>
 
<p>The contractor will conduct all necessary monitoring of fish, crab and shrimp abundance and distribution along the edges of marshes and report on each year’s findings.  The area is subject to substantial tidal influence, so boat access will be required.</p>
 
<p><span class="sectionName">PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE</span>: All work under this task order shall be completed within the years specified in relation to the construction date.</p>
