<h1>17. Monitoring of Marsh Restoration at Savannah Harbor Dredged Material Containment Area 1S</h1>
 
<p>As part of the Savannah Harbor Expansion Project, the US Army Corps of Engineers, Savannah District (Corps) committed to monitor the marsh restoration site at Dredged Material Containment Area (DMCA) 1S to ensure the restoration produces the mitigation acreage required for direct impacts to wetlands that will be unavoidably affected as part of SHEP construction activities.  The Savannah District Planning Division (PD) and Operations Division (OP-N) will conduct the field work.</p>
 
<p>PD and OP-N will jointly perform the field work described in this scope of work.  Upon completion of construction activities at DMCA 1S, PD representatives will identify the location of wetlands in the vicinity of DMCA 1S that will serve as a reference site.  The Corps will document conditions at the reference site using written descriptions and photographs of plant species present and their relative abundance.  Once the site is established, the Corps will visit the reference site and document conditions a minimum of two times each year -- once in the winter and once in the summer -- to facilitate evaluation of the typical plant growth during differing times of year.</p>
 
<p><span class="sectionName">PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE</span>: The work described above will begin upon completion of wetland restoration activities at DMCA 1S and will continue for at least seven years.  The construction is scheduled to be completed by December 2016.  The seven years of post-construction monitoring would continue through 2023.</p>
