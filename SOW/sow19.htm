<h1>19. Use of the Fish Bypass at New Savannah Bluff Lock and Dam</h1>
 
<p>As part of the Savannah Harbor Expansion Project, the US Army Corps of Engineers, Savannah District (Corps) committed to monitor the use of sturgeon and anadromous fish of the off-channel rock ramp bypass that the project is constructing around the New Savannah Bluff Lock and Dam near Augusta, Georgia.  The South Carolina Department of Natural Resources (SC DNR) will conduct telemetry studies as identified in this scope of work (SOW) to collect information on fish use of the structure, analyze the data, and provide reports to the Corps.</p>
 
<p>Monitoring Atlantic and Shortnose sturgeon use of the off-channel rock ramp fish bypass at the New Savannah Bluff Lock and Dam will be accomplished through the use of telemetry and sonic transmitters.  The work will identify the distribution of sturgeon in the upper Savannah River over the course of a year and identify seasonal habitats, migration patterns, and possibly spawning locations.  The work would be conducted using the same type of transmitters and receivers as are presently being used by SC DNR in a study they are performing for NOAA Fisheries titled “Research and Management of Endangered and Threatened Species in the Southeast: Riverine Movements of Shortnose and Atlantic sturgeon”.  Different models of transmitters and receivers may be used with prior permission from the Corps.</p>
 
<p><span class="sectionName">PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE</span>: Initial installation of transmitters would be conducted in the fall of 2013 and spring of 2014.  The telemetry would begin in the spring of 2014.  The monitoring in 2014 would serve as a baseline for additional studies that would be performed after the fish bypass is constructed.</p>
 
<p>SC DNR would perform this work intermittently through 2025.  SC DNR would perform this same work each of the identified years (baseline and in years 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 9 after the bypass is available for use by fish).  Based on the present schedule, the monitoring would be performed in the spring of 2014, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, and 2025.</p>
