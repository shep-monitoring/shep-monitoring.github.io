<h1>4. Bathymetric Profile Survey</h1>

<p>As part
of the Savannah Harbor Expansion Project, the US Army Corps of Engineers, Savannah District (Corps) committed to perform a bathymetric centerline profile every four months during construction of the rock sill sediment basin.</p>

<p>The
Georgia Department of Natural Resources, Environmental Protection Division (GA DNR-EPD) issued a Water Quality Certification for SHEP on February 16, 2011. That certification requires bathymetric surveys every four months during construction of the rock sill.</p>

<p>A centerline bathymetric (profile) survey of the Back River shall be conducted from its downstream confluence with the Front River proceeding upstream to US 17. Survey points should be less than 25’ apart. Perform two cross-sections at each area under construction (top of sill; tide gate). Horizontal control shall be NAD83 Georgia East state plane coordinate system.</p>

<p>Vertical
control shall be Mean Lower Low Water, Epoch 1983-2001 datum.</p>

<p><span class="sectionName">PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE</span>: The work described above will begin upon commencement of the rock sill construction project, part of the Savannah Harbor Expansion Project, currently scheduled to begin in September 2014, and continue throughout the duration of the construction period, estimated to be 4 years.</p>
