<h1>11. Bathymetric Surveys in Unique Areas</h1>
 

<p>As part of the Savannah Harbor Expansion Project, the US Army Corps of Engineers, Savannah District (Corps) committed to perform a bathymetric survey of the Savannah River Harbor from Fort Jackson to I-95, including Front, Middle, and Back Rivers.</p>
 
<p>The Georgia Department of Natural Resources, Environmental Protection Division (GA DNR-EPD) issued a Water Quality Certification for SHEP on February 16, 2011.  That certification requires a bathymetric survey of the Savannah River Harbor from Fort Jackson to I-95, including Front, Middle, and Back Rivers. Cross-sections should be less than 250’ apart, and should extend to top of each bank. This survey must be completed two times.</p>
 

<p><span class="sectionName">PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE</span>:  The survey work described above will be completed twice. The first shall be one year following completion of construction. The second shall be five years following completion of construction.</p>
