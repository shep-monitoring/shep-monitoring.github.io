<h1>18. Sturgeon Distribution Study in the Savannah River Estuary</h1>
 
<p>As part of the Savannah Harbor Expansion Project, the US Army Corps of Engineers, Savannah District (Corps) committed to monitor the distribution of sturgeon in the Savannah River Estuary.  The South Carolina Department of Natural Resources (SC DNR) will conduct telemetry studies as identified in this SOW to collect that information, analyze the data, and provide reports to the Corps.</p>
 
<p>The Corps has committed to monitoring sturgeon distribution in the estuary for one year pre-construction, during construction (duration of 4 years), and post-construction years 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 9.  It is anticipated that the deployment of transmitters and other field work must be conducted annually, with the exception of post-construction monitoring period years 6, 7, and 8, as described below to cover the entire monitoring period.</p>
 
<p><span class="sectionName">PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE</span>: The telemetry would begin in the summer of 2013.  SC DNR would perform this work intermittently through 2025.</p>
 
<p>SC DNR would perform this same work each of the identified years (baseline, during harbor deepening, and in years 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 9 after the deepening has been completed).  Based on the present schedule, the monitoring would be performed in 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, and 2025.</p>
