<h1>13. Determination of the Freshwater Interface in the Savannah Harbor</h1>
 
<p>As part of the Savannah Harbor Expansion Project, the US Army Corps of Engineers, Savannah District (Corps) committed to identify the location of the freshwater interface during both high and low tides in the Front, Middle, and Back Rivers.  This study will be accomplished by measuring dissolved oxygen and salinity during years 3 and 8 of the post-construction monitoring period.  The study results will be compared to those locations predicted by the hydrodynamic and water quality models.  As flows and other environmental factors which influence the freshwater interface are variable, the exact timing of the study will be determined in consultation with all the resource agencies.  The Savannah District Hydrology and Hydraulics Branch (EN-H) will conduct the field work in coordination with Planning Division (PD). </p>
 
<p>EN-H will perform the field work to determine the location of the freshwater interface.  The work will be accomplished by measuring salinity at the water surface along transects along the length of the river to identify the interface, which for this study is defined as the 0.5 ppt chloride contour line.  Measurements would be made with a YSI 6600 EDS (Extended Deployment Sonde) with YSI 650 MDS Handheld Display unit or similar instrument.</p>
 
<p><span class="sectionName">PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE</span>: The work described above will begin upon commencement of inner harbor dredging for the Savannah Harbor Expansion Project, currently scheduled to begin in September 2014, and continue throughout the duration of the construction period, estimated to be 4 years.</p>
