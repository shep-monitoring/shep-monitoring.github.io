<h1>14. Chloride Monitoring at Abercorn Creek Intake</h1>
 

<p>Experience in gage results from this and other basins, combined with chloride modeling results, tells us that chloride spikes can be expected at the Abercorn Creek intake when spring high tides coincide with low flow in the Savannah River.  Collecting samples and performing laboratory analyses is a costly exercise that will produce no useful data if the requisite flow and tide conditions are not present.  For this reason, the exact timing of sample collection and lab analyses cannot be projected in advance. </p>
 
<p>Data gathered from the laboratory analysis of the collected water samples and from the water quality meter will be used to confirm predictive modeling performed during the study and design phases. Reports will be prepared summarizing both the gage data, laboratory analysis of grab samples, and correlation of the two.  Comparison of the lab data to the meter data will be used to verify the factory-estimated error range of the chloride meter.  The natural resource agencies are expected to be involved in reviewing these reports.   </p>
 
<p>The goal of this task is to demonstrate that increases to chloride spike events resulting from the SHEP have been properly predicted and appropriately mitigated for.  The ability to adequately resolve this goal will be greatly dependent upon climate conditions during the 5-year monitoring period.  If there are no coincidental occurrences of low river flows and spring high tides, then there will be insufficient data to make such a determination.   </p>

<p><span class="sectionName">PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE</span>: The performance period for this task will begin with commencement of construction and continue for 5 years post-construction.  Automated water quality gaging on Abercorn Creek near the City of Savannah water intake will be continuous throughout the period of performance.   Grab samples and laboratory analysis will be performed intermittently throughout the performance period.</p>
