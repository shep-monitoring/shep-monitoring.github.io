<h1>22. Wildlife Use in Dredged Material Containment Areas (Avian/Terrestrial Field Counts)</h1> 
 
<p>As part of the Savannah Harbor Expansion Project (SHEP), the US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) committed to monitoring wildlife use in Dredged Material Containment Areas (DMCAs) designated to receive new work sediments from the inner harbor.  This Scope of Work (SOW) outlines the work necessary to monitor avian and other major vertebrate abundance and usage at the Savannah Harbor Dredged Material Containment Areas during construction of the project and for years 1, 2, and 3 of the post-construction monitoring period.  This information may be critical if other investigations indicate a problem with wildlife use of DMCAs 14A/14B where cadmium-laden sediments will be deposited.</p>
 
<p>A monitoring report summary will be prepared that provides a brief overview of the work performed the prior month.  Upon completion of a year of fieldwork, a report would be prepared that includes a description of the work performed, results, and any findings.  Upon completion of the final year of fieldwork, a comprehensive report would be prepared that describes all the work performed, the results, and the findings.  The reports will be provided to the USFWS.</p>
 
<p><span class="sectionName">PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE</span>: USACE biologists would perform monthly wildlife use surveys in DMCAs 12A, 13A, 13B, 14A, and 14B.  These surveys would record all birds and other major vertebrates observed within those DMCAs.  Monitoring would be performed during placement of SHEP new work sediments and for a minimum of three years after placement is complete.  The monitoring would continue as long as other cadmium-related sampling is occurring.  Weekly monitoring of target avian species to determine arrival dates and ensure capture (under a different SOW) within two weeks of arrival will be conducted, most likely in April or September. </p>
